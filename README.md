# Personal Website

I started this journey into software engineering less than 12 months ago.  While I've mostly focused on learning _engineering_ and _python_;  I've been consistently _learning in public_.  This website will try to centralize all that content.

More than a portfolio website, it's meant to serve as a personal landing page where I can keep track of the content I share, like, and to keep a journal of what I'm up to!
